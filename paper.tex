\section{Introduction}

Emergig powered prothetics are in need of bio-inspired control systems.
Ideally, a powered prosthetic would behave in such a way that the user would
feel like their limb was never disabled. There are a variety of approaches to
developing bio-inspired control systems some of which aim to mimic the
reactions and motion of an abled bodied person. A modern gait lab is able to
collect a variety of kinmetic, kinetic, and physiological data from humans
during gait. This data can be used to drive the design of the controller. With
a rich enough data set, one may be able to identify control mechanism used
during a human's natural gait and recovery from perturbations. We have
collected one such data set that we believe is richer than previous gait data
sets and may be rich enough for control identification. The data can also be
used for verifciation purposes for controllers that have been designed in other
manners.

We collected over five and half hours of perturbed gait data from 11 subjects
sampled at 100 hz. The data has been organized and made available for other
research uses.
