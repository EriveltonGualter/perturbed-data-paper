\begin{abstract}

  Here we share a rich gait data set collected from fifteen subjects walking at
  three speeds on an instrumented treadmill. Each trial consists of 120 seconds
  of normal walking and 480 seconds of walking while being longitudinally
  and/or laterally perturbed during each stance phase with pseudo-random
  fluctuations in the speed of the treadmill belt. A total of approximately 1.5
  hours of normal walking ($>5000$ gait cycles) and 6 hours of perturbed walking
  ($>20,000$ gait cycles) is included in the data set. We provide full body
  marker trajectories and ground reaction loads in addition to a presentation of
  processed data that includes gait landmarks, 2D joint angles, angular rates,
  and joint torques and the software used for the computations. The protocol is
  described in detail along with additional elaborate meta data. This data can
  likely be useful for validating or generating mathematical models that are
  capable of simulating normal periodic gait and non-periodic, perturbed gaits.

\section*{Introduction}
%
The collection of dynamical data during human walking has a long history
beginning with the first motion pictures and now with modern marker based
motion capture techniques, image and video analysis, and high fidelity ground
reaction load measurements. Even though years of data on thousands of subjects
now exist, this data is not widely disseminated, well organized, nor available
with few or no restrictions. David Winter's published normative gait
data~\cite{Winter1990} is widely used in biomechanics studies, yet it comes
from relatively few subjects and only a small number of gait cycles per
subject. This small source has successfully inspired powered prosthetic control
design~\cite{GoldfarbXXXX}, but success in other fields using large sets of
data for discovery lead one to believe that may be possible in the
biomechanical field too. To find out if that hypothesis is true, our data needs
to be shared extensively, organized, and curated to enabled analysts.

There are some notable gait data sets and databases besides Winter's authoritative
set that are publicly available. Notably the International Society of
Biomechanics has maintained a web page (http://isbweb.org/data) since
approximately 1995 that includes data sets for download and most unencumbered
use. Vaughn, et. al's data~\cite{Vaughan1992} with kinematics and force plate
measurement from several subjects. Chris Kirtley shares normative gait from
several studies on the CGA Normative Gait Database~\cite{Kirtley} and these
files have influenced and been included in other studies, for
example the average gait cycles from children used in~\cite{Bogert2003}.

Chester et. al~\cite{Chester2007} report on a large gait database comparison
where one database contained kinematic data of 409 gait cycles of children
from 1 to 7 years old. Tirosh et. al, recognized the need of a comprehensive
data base for clinical gait data and created the Gaitabase~\cite{Tirosh2010}.
This database may contain a substantial amount of data but it is encumbered by
a very complicated and restrictive license and sharing scheme. The University
of Wisconsin at LaCrosse has a normative gait data set~\cite{Wilson} from 25
subjects with lower extremity marker data and force plate measurements from a
single stance phase.

More recent examples of biomechanist's sharing their data alongside
publications are: \cite{Bogert2013} which includes processed joint kinematics
from eleven subjects walking for few gait cycles and \cite{Wang2014} who
includes data from 10 subjects walking for five minutes each at five different
speeds but only a small set of lower extremity markers are present. The second
is notable because it publishes the data in Dryad, a modern citable data
repository.

The publicly available gait data is small compared to the number of gait
studies that have been performed over the years. And the data that is available
in general suffers from things such as few subjects, few gait cycles, few
markers, no raw data, limited force plate measurements, lack of meta data, and
restrictive licensing. To help with this situation we are making the data we
collected for our research purposes publicly available and free of the
previously mentioned deficiencies. Not only do we provide a larger set of
normative gait data that has been previously available we include an even large
set of data in which the subject is being perturbed which does not exist at
all. We believe both of these sets of data can serve a variety of use cases and
hope that we can save time for researchers with use cases for this data.

Our use case for the data is centered around emerging powered prosthetics and
orthotics need of bio-inspired control systems. Ideally, a powered prosthetic
would behave in such a way that the user would feel like their limb was never
disabled. There are a variety of approaches to developing bio-inspired control
systems some of which aim to mimic the reactions and motion of an able-bodied
person. A modern gait lab is able to collect a variety of kinematic, kinetic,
and physiological data from humans during gait. This data can potentially be
used to drive the design of the human-mimicking controller. With a rich enough
data set, one may be able to identify control mechanisms used during a human's
natural gait and recovery from perturbations. We have collected data that we
believe is richer than previous gait data sets and may be rich enough for
control identification.  The data can also be used for verification purposes
for controllers that have been designed in other manners.

With all of this in mind, we collected over five and half hours of gait data
from fifteen able bodied subjects and includes over 25,000 gait cycles. Most of
the subjects walked at three different speeds on an instrumented treadmill
while we collected full body marker locations and ground reaction loads from a
pair of force plates. The protocol for the majority of the trials includes two
minutes of normal walking and eight minutes of walking under the influence of
pseudo-random belt speed fluctuations. The data has been organized complete with
rich meta data and made available in the most unrestrictive form for other
research uses following modern best practices in data sharing~\cite{White2013}.

Furthermore, we include a small Apache licensed open source software library
for basic gait analysis and demonstrate it's use in the paper. The combination
of the open data and open software allow the results presented within to be
computationally reproducible and instructions are included in the associated
repository for doing so.

\section*{Participants}
%
Fifteen able bodied subjects including four females and eleven males with an
average age of $24\pm4$ years, height of $1.75\pm0.09$ m, mass of $74\pm13$ kg
participated in the study. The data has been anonymized with respect to the
participants' identities and an unique identification number was assigned to
each subject. A selection of the meta data collected for each subject is shown
in Table~\ref{tab:subjects}.
%
\begin{table*}
  \cprotect\caption{Information about the 15 participants. The final three
    columns give the trial numbers associated with each nominal treadmill

    not shown in the table. Generated by \verb|src/subject_table.py|.}
  \centering
  \input{tables/subjects.tex}
  \label{tab:subjects}
\end{table*}

\section*{Equipment}
%
The Human Motion and Control Lab at Cleveland State University has modern human
motion measurement equipment. Our system includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A ForceLink R-Mill treadmill which has dual 6 degree of freedom force
    plates, independent belts for each foot, and motion capabilities (lateral,
    pitch).
  \item A 10 camera Motion Analysis motion capture system which includes Osprey
    cameras, the Cortex software (3.1.1.1290), and hardware for collecting
    analog and camera data simultaneously.
  \item National Instruments USB-6255 data acquisition unit.
  \item Four Sparkfun ADXL330 Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout boards
    attached to the treadmill.
  \item Motek Medicalâ€™s D-Flow software (3.16.1 to 3.16.2) and visual display
    system.
\end{itemize}

Cortex alone is capable of delivering data from the cameras along with force
plates, and analog sensors (EMG/Accelerometer) through a National Instruments
USB-6255 data acquisition unit. D-Flow is required to collect data from any
digital sensors and the treadmill's motion (lateral, pitch, and belts). D-Flow
can output multiple types of files which contain the different data.

Our motion capture system's coordinate system is such that the X coordinate
points to the right, the Y coordinate points upwards, and the Z coordinate
follows from the right-hand-rule, i.e. points backwards with respect to a
person walking forward on the treadmill. The camera's coordinate system is
aligned to an origin point on treadmill's surface during camera calibration.
The same point is used as the origin of the ground reaction force measuring
system.

\section*{Protocol}
%
The experimental protocol consisted of static measurements and walking on the
treadmill for 10 minutes under unperturbed and perturbed conditions. Before a
set of trials on the same day the following happened:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Calibration of the motion capture system.
  \item Subject changes into athletic shoes, shorts, sports bra, baseball
    cap, and rock climbing harness.
  \item All 47 markers are applied directly to the skin except for the heel,
    toe, and head markers.~\footnote{The sacrum and rear pelvic markers were
    placed on the shorts for a small number of the subjects}.
  \item Subjects self-reported age, gender, and mass.
  \item Height is measured by the experimentalist.
  \item Four reference photographs (front, back, right, left) are taken of
    subjects marker locations.
\end{itemize}

After a briefing by the experimentalist on the trial protocol the subject
follows the verbal instructions of the experimentalist and the on-screen
instructions from the video display in front of the subject. The protocol goes
as so:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Subject steps onto the treadmill and markers are identified with
    Cortex.
  \item The safety cable is attached loosely to the rock climbing harness such
    that no undue forces are acting on the subject during walking, but that the
    harness will prevent a full fall.
  \item The subject starts by stepping on sides of treadmill so that feet don't
    touch the force plates and the force plate signals are zeroed.
  \item Once notified by the screen, the subject stands in the initialization
    pose: standing straight up, looking forward, arms out by their sides (~45
    degrees) and the event is manually recorded by the operator.
  \item A countdown to the first normal walking phase is displayed. At the end
    of the countdown the treadmill starts at the specified speed and the
    subject is instructed to walk normally, to focus on the road in the
    screen, and not to look at their feet.
  \item After 1 minute of normal walking, the longitudinal perturbation phase
    begins.
  \item After 8 minutes of walking under the influence of the perturbations,
    the normal walking phase begins.
  \item After 1 minute, a countdown is shown and the treadmill decelerates to a
    stop.
  \item The subject is instructed to step off of the force plates for 10
    seconds.
  \item The subject could take a break before each additional trial.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Perturbation Signals}
%
The data set uses a testing protocol containing a segment of normal walking,
followed by a series of pseudo-random longitudinal perturbations, and ending
with a second segment of normal walking. Three pseudo-random speed control
signals, with mean velocities of 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 $m \cdot s^{-1}$, were
generated through MATLAB and Simulink. Initially, a  random acceleration signal
was created using discrete-time Gaussian white noise and saturated at the
maximum belt acceleration of 15 $m \cdot s^{-2}$, integrated to obtain belt
speed, and high-pass filtered (second-order Butterworth) to eliminate velocity
drift. Mean velocity was then added to the signal and limited between 0 and 3.6
m/s. The cutoff frequencies of the high-pass filter, as well as the variance in
the acceleration signal, were adjusted until the appropriate standard
deviations for each mean velocity were obtained.

These standard deviations were determined through a trial and error method.
Initially, perturbations of $\pm$ 10\% for each mean velocity were generated.
However, this large deviation in the slowest mean velocity (0.8 $m \cdot
s^{-1}$) would unintentionally reduce the treadmill speed to values close to
zero. This would produce an undesired stopping and starting sensation.
Alternatively, smaller standard perturbations of $\pm$ 5\% did not produce
noticeable perturbations in the fastest trial (1.6 $m \cdot s^{-1}$).
Therefore, standard deviations of 7.16\%, 10.23\%, and 13.1\% were selected for
the 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 $m \cdot s^{-1}$ speeds, respectively.  This ensured that
the test subject was sufficiently perturbed for each speed, while remaining
within the limits of our testing protocol.

To ensure that the treadmill could follow the higher frequencies of the random
signals, the maximum treadmill acceleration of 15 $m \cdot s^{-2}$ was used in
the D-Flow Software. As this value remains constant throughout the experiment,
the initial starting and stopping of the treadmill would be too rapid for test
subjects. To eliminate this, a ramped acceleration and deceleration was
generated and placed at the beginning and end of the entire signal,
respectively. Other additions include the one minute segments of unperturbed
walking at the beginning and end of the trial and 30 seconds of no movement for
force plate zeroing and subject T-pose calibration.  The sampling rate of the
simulation was set to 100 Hz, corresponding to the D-Flow software's
capabilities.

The resulting output from the MATLAB script and Simulink produces a comma-
delimited text file of six columns: time stamp, slow, normal, and fast walking
perturbation signals, and slow and fast running signals.  These running signals
were generated in the event the testing protocol expanded from a walking study
to a running study, though they were not used in the data set.  The actual
motion of the treadmill belts are compared to the original input signals as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:input_output}.   The standard deviations of the
outputs were calculated at 6.07\%, 9.68\%, and 12.68\% for the 0.8, 1.2,
and 1.6 $m \cdot s^{-1}$ speeds, respectively.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/input_vs_output.pdf}
  \caption{Treadmill belt velocity input signals (purple) and recorded output
    velocities (blue) for average belt speeds of 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s,
    respectively}
  \label{fig:input_output}
\end{figure*}

For further analysis, the input and output signals for each average speed were
transformed into the frequency domain through the Fast Fourier algorithm, and
the results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:freq_analysis}. It was observed that
for the 1.2 $m \cdot s^{-1}$ average walking speed, the amplitude of the output
is significantly lower than the amplitude of the input signal at lower
frequencies. Additionally, the amplitude of output signal in the 0.8 $m \cdot
s^{-1}$ walking speed begins to attenuate around 2 Hz, which is a noticeably
lower frequency than the other walking speeds.

\end{figure*}

\section*{Raw Data}
%
The raw data consists of a set of ASCII tab delimited text files output from
both the ``mocap'' and ``record'' modules in D-Flow in addition to a YAML file
that contains all of the necessary meta data for the given trial. These three
files are stored in a hierarchy of directories with one trial per directory.
The directories are named in the following fashion \verb+T001/+ where \verb+T+
stands for ``trial'' and the following three digits are provide a unique trial
identification number.

The text file output from the mocap module in D-Flow is a tab delimited file.
The first line is the header and contains a time stamp column, frame number
column, marker position columns, force plate force/moment columns, force plate
center of pressure columns, other analog columns, and potentially results from
the real time Human Body Model \cite{Bogert2013} which is included with the
D-Flow software. These are detailed below. The numerical values of the
measurements are provided in decimal floating point notation with 6 decimals of
precision, e.g. 123456.123456 [\%1.6f].

\subsection*{mocap-xxx.txt}

The output from the D-Flow mocap module is stored in a tab delimited file named
\verb+mocap-xxx.txt+ where \verb+xxx+ represents the trial id number. The file
contains several columns:

\begin{description}
  \item[TimeStamp] The monotonically increasing computer clock time when D-Flow
    receives a frame from Cortex. These are approximately at 100 hz and given
    in seconds.
  \item[FrameNumber] Monotonically increasing positive integers that correspond
    to each frame received from Cortex.
  \item[Marker Coordinates] Any column that ends in \verb+.PosX+, \verb+.PosY+,
    or \verb+.PosZ+ are marker coordinates expressed in Cortex's Cartesian
    reference frame. These values are in meters.
  \item[Ground Reaction Loads] There are three ground reaction forces and three
    ground reaction moments recorded by each of the two force plates in Newtons
    and Newton-Meters, respectively. The prefix for these columns is either
    \verb+FP1+ or \verb+FP2+ and represents either force plate 1 (left) or 2
    (right). The suffixes are either \verb+.For[XYZ]+, \verb+.Mom[XYZ]+ for the
    forces and moments, respectively. The force plate voltages are sampled at a
    much higher frequency than the cameras, but delivered at the Cortex camera
    sample rate, 100 Hz through the D-Flow mocap module. A force/moment
    calibration matrix stored in Cortex converts the voltages to forces and
    moments before sending it to D-Flow [1]. Cortex also computes the center of
    pressure from the forces, moments, and force plate dimensions. These have
    the same prefixes for the plate number, have the suffix \verb+.Cop[XYZ]+,
    and are in meters.
  \item[Analog Channels] Several analog signals are recorded under column
    headers \verb+Channel[1-99].Anlg+. These correspond to analog signals
    sampled by Cortex and correspond to the 96 analog-channel National
    Instruments 6255 DAQ box. The first twelve are the voltages from the
    force plate load cells. We also record the acceleration of 4 points on the
    treadmill base in channels 61-72.  TvdB: are these useful?  If so, we need to
    provide information on how to process these channels. If not, maybe
    not mention them at all?
\end{description}

\subsection*{record-xxx.txt}
%
The record module also outputs a tab delimited ASCII text file. It includes a
\verb+Time+ column which records the D-Flow system time in seconds which
corresponds to the time recorded in the \verb+TimeStamp+ column in mocap module
tsv file. There are two additional columns \verb+RightBeltSpeed+ and
\verb+LeftBeltSpeed+ which provide the independent belt speeds measured in
meters per second by an encoder in the treadmill.

Finally, the record module is capable of recording the time at which various
events occur, as detected or set by D-Flow. It does this by inserting commented
(\#) lines in between the rows when the event occurred. The record files have
several events that correspond to the phases of the protocol:

\begin{description}
  \item[A: Force Plate Zeroing] Marks the time at which there is no load on the
    force plates and when the voltages were zeroed.
  \item[B: Calibration Pose] Marks the time at which the person is in the
    T-Pose.
  \item[C: First Normal Walking] Marks the time when the treadmill begins Phase
    1: constant belt speed.
  \item[D: Longitudinal Perturbation] Marks the time when the treadmill begins
    Phase 2: longitudinal perturbations in the belt speed.
  \item[E: Second Normal Walking] Marks the time when phase 3 starts: constant
    belt speed.
  \item[F: Unloaded End] Marks the time at which there is no load on the force
    plates and the belts are stationary.
\end{description}

\subsection*{meta-xxx.yml}

Each trial directory contains a meta data file in the YAML format named in the
following style \verb|meta-xxx.yml| where \verb|xxx| is the three digit trial
identification number. There are three main headings in the file: \verb+study+,
\verb+subject+, and \verb+trial+. An example meta data file is shown in Listing
\ref{lis:example-meta-data}.

The \verb+study+ section contains identifying information for the overall

  \item[id] An integer specifying a unique identification number of the study.
  \item[name] A string giving the name of the study.
  \item[description] A string with a basic description of the study.

  \item[mass-units] A string specifying the units of the mass measurement.
\end{description}

The \verb+trial+ section contains the information about the particular trial.
Each trial has a unique identification number along with a variety of other
information, detailed below:

\begin{description}

We make use of the full body 47 marker set described in \cite{Bogert2013}
and presented in detail in Table \ref{tab:marker-labels}. As with all camera
based motion capture systems, the markers sometimes go missing in the
recording.

If the data was recorded in a D-Flow version less than 3.16.2rc4 [3], D-Flow
records the last non-missing value in all three axes until the marker is
visible again when a marker goes missing.

In D-Flow versions greater than or equal to 3.16.2rc4 the missing markers are
indicated in the TSV file as either 0.000000 or -0.000000, which is the same as
has been in the HBM columns in all versions of D-Flow. The D-Flow version must
be provided in the meta data yml file, otherwise it will assume D-Flow is at
the latest version.

\section*{Processed Data}

We developed a toolkit for data processing, GaitAnalysisToolKit, for common
gait computations and provide an example processed trial to show the character
of the data. The tool was developed in Python, is dependent on the SciPy Stack,
and provides two main classes: one to do basic gait data cleaning,
\verb|DFlowData|, and a second to compute common gait variables of interest,
\verb|GaitData|.

The \verb|DFlowData| class collects and stores all the raw data presented in
the previous section and applies several ``cleaning'' operations to transform
the data into a usable form. The cleaning process follows these basic steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Loads the meta data file into a Python dictionary.
  \item Loads the D-Flow mocap module TSV file into Pandas \verb|DataFrame|.
  \item Relabels the column headers to more meaningful names if this is
    specified in the meta data.
  \item Optionally identifies the missing values in the mocap marker data and
    replaces them with \verb|numpy.nan|.
  \item Optionally interpolates the missing marker values and replaces them
    with interpolated estimates using a variety of interpolation methods.
  \item Loads the D-Flow record module TSV file into a Pandas \verb|DataFrame|.
  \item Extracts the events and creates a dictionary mapping the event names in
    the meta data to the events detected in the record module file.
  \item Compensates the ground reaction loads based on whether the meta data
    indicates there was treadmill motion.
  \item Merges the data from the mocap module and record module into one data
    frame at the maximum common constant sample rate.
\end{enumerate}

Once the data is cleaned there are two methods that allow you to extract the
cleaned data:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extract sections of the data bounded by the events recorded in the
    \verb|record-XXX.txt| file.
  \item Save the cleaned data to disk.
\end{itemize}

An example of the API is given in Listing~\ref{lis:dflowdata}.

\begin{listing*}
  \begin{minted}[gobble=4]{python}
    >>> from gaitanalysis.motek import DFlowData
    >>> data = DFlowData('mocap-020.txt', 'record-020.txt', 'meta-020.yml')
    >>> mass = data.meta['subject']['mass']
    >>> data.clean_data()
    >>> event_df = dflow_data.extract_processed_data(event='Longitudinal Perturbation')
  \end{minted}
  \cprotect\caption{Python interpreter session showing how one could load a
    trial into memory, extract the subject's mass from the meta data, run the
    data cleaning process, and finally extract a Pandas \verb|DataFrame|
    containing all of the time histories for a specific event in the trial.}
  \label{lis:dflowdata}
\end{listing*}

The \verb|GaitData| class is then used to compute things such as gait landmarks
(toe off and heel strike times), basic 2D inverse dynamics, and to store the
data into a Pandas \verb|Panel| with each gait cycle on the main axis at a
specified sample rate. This data is also saved to disk in HDF5 format.

\begin{listing*}
  \begin{minted}[gobble=4]{python}
    >>> from gaitanalysis.gait import GaitData
    >>> gdata = GaitData(event_df)
    >>> gdata.inverse_dynamics_2d(left_markers, right_markers, left_loads,
    ...                           right_loads, mass, 6.0)
    >>> gdata.grf_landmarks('Right Fy', 'Left Fy', threshhold=20.0)
    >>> gdata.split_at('right')
    >>> gdata.plot_gait_cycles('Left Hip Joint Torque', mean=True)
    >>> gdata.save('gait-data.h5')
  \end{minted}
  \cprotect\caption{Python interpreter session showing how one could compute
    the inverse dynamics (joint angles and torques), identify the gait
    landmarks (e.g. heel strikes), split the data with respect to the gait
    landmarks in a Pandas \verb|Panel|, plot the mean and standard deviation of
    one time history with respect to the gait cycles, and save the data to disk.}
  \label{lis:dflowdata}
\end{listing*}

A similar work flow was used to produce Figure~\ref{fig:angle-torque-comparison}
which compares the mean and standard deviation of saggital plane joint angles
and torques from the perturbed gait cycles and the unperturbed gait cycles
computed from trial 20 for 120 gait cycles. The variation in the dynamics is
larger for the perturbed gait cycles.

    (blue) gait cycles from trial 20. Produced by \verb|unperturbed_perturbed_comparison.py|.}
  \label{fig:angle-torque-comparison}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:gait-cycle-stats-comparison} compares the distribution in a few
statistics of the unperturbed and perturbed gait cycles.

\section*{Data Limitations}
%
The data is provided in good faith with great attention to detail. The
following list gives various notes and warnings about the data that should be
taken into account when making use of it.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Be sure to read the notes in each meta data file for details about
    possible anomalies in that particular trial.
  \item The subject identification number 0 stands for "no subject" and was
    used whenever data was collected from the system with no subject on the
    treadmill, for example during the trials that were intended to be used for
    inertial compensation purposes if the treadmill was moving. These trials
    play through the exact protocol as those with a human subject and the
    matching trials are indicated in the meta data.
  \item Trials 1 and 2 were not recorded as part of this study. Those trial
    identification numbers were reserved for early data exploration from data
    collected in other studies.
  \item Trials 37, 38, and 39 do not exist. The numbers were accidentally
    skipped.
  \item Trials 9, 10, and 11 used a slightly different event definition where the
    calibration poses were not explicitly tagged by an event, yet the protocol
    was the identical to the following trials.
  \item During trials 9-15 we used wooden blocks to fix the treadmill to the
    concrete floor to eliminate the treadmill's lowest factory vibration mode
    (~5 hz). But these blocks seem to have corrupted the force plate
    measurements by imposing undue stresses on the system. The force plate
    measurements should not be used from these trials, but the marker data is
    fine.
  \item We did not record unloaded compensation trials for trials 9-15.
    Regardless, they would be useless due to the previous point.
  \item Trials 6-8 use an early experimental protocol which divided the
    perturbation sections into three sections: longitudinal perturbations,
    lateral perturbations, and a combination of each. We then learned the
    treadmill had a low vibrational mode which significantly affects the force
    plate measurements. The force measurements during these trials are
    corrupted by this vibrational mode and should be used with caution or not
    at all.
  \item Trials 6-8 use a XX lower body marker set only.
  \item The ankle joint torques computed from subject 9's data in trials 25-27
    are abnormal and should be used with caution or not at all. We were not
    about to locate the source of the error, but it is likely related to the
    force calibration.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}

We have presented the details of what we believe to be a rich dataset of motion
and ground reaction loads humans exhibit when recovering from minor
longitudinal perturbations. The data provides a large sample of gait cycles
from both unperturbed and perturbed walking at three different nominal speeds.
The raw data is provided for reuse with sufficient detail with regards to meta
data and technical details. In addition to the data, we provide software that
can process the data for cleaning purposes and to produce typical saggital
plane gait variables of interest. Among other uses, we believe the dataset is
ideally suited for control identification purposes. Many researchers are
working on mathematical models for control in gait and this dataset provides
both a way to validate these models and data that can be used to generate
models.
